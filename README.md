LIBRARY MANEGMENT SYSTEM.

1	INTRODUCTION:
A Library Management System is a software solution designed to manage and organize the operations of a library. It automates various tasks involved in library management, such as cataloging books, tracking inventory, issuing and returning books, managing member records, and generating reports. An ASP.NET Web Application provides a robust and scalable platform to develop such a system, allowing users to access it through a web browser.

The system provides a user-friendly interface for both librarians and library members, allowing them to perform various tasks with ease.

FIRSTLY, WE RUN THE PROGRAM AND THE HOMEPAGE WILL APPEAR WHERE WILL BE ABLE TO LOGIN AS A USER OR ADMIN(LIBRARIAN). STARTING WITH THE ADMIN AFTER CLICKING ON LOGIN AS ADMIN WILL APPEAR A LOGIN PAGE PANEL WE WILL SEE TWO TEXT BOXES FOR USERNAME AND PASSWORD. IF THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FIELD IS EMPTY IT WONT LOGIN AND WILL GIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE. IF THE PASSWORD OR USERNAME IS INCORRECT WILL ALSO GIVE THE ERROR MESSAGE.
